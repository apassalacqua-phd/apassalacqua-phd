Using a novel confidential dataset containing consumer complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and matching it with confidential data on mortgages, deposits, and market prices, we find that banks subject to prudential and CFPB oversight, which receive consumer complaints experience a decline in their share prices and an increase in trading volumes. These banks also see a decrease in deposit and mortgage market shares, with more complaints resulting in higher deposit withdrawals. We find limited evidence that banks change deposit rates in response. Finally, we implement textual analysis to study the differential impact of consumer complaints. First, we identify the main topics related to the complaints. Second, we find that consumer disappointment is associated with a decrease in aggregate deposits. Overall, we provide new evidence on the role of information disclosure as a disciplinary mechanism in providing credit.\n(previously circulated as “Regulatory Disclosure and Access to Credit”)</p>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/research/disciplining-banks-through-disclosure-evidence-from-cfpb-consumer-complaints/suggested_citation_bibtex.pdf\">Suggested Citation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/research/disciplining-banks-through-disclosure-evidence-from-cfpb-consumer-complaints/real_effect_banking_inspection_august2021.pdf\">Paper Link</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>presented by co-author.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Disciplining Banks through Disclosure - Evidence from CFPB Consumer Complaints","date":"May 06, 2015","description":"Disciplining Banks through Disclosure - Evidence from CFPB Consumer Complaints - with Anya Kleymenova, Jeffrey Jou, Laszlo Sandor, and Rajesh Vijayaraghavan","category":"research","subCategory":"Publications","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/cf57d08958a476d227c08cebbaf02d18/cover.png"}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/discussions/papanikolaou-sun-the-impact-of-traditional-and-modern-media-on-financial-stability/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Papanikolaou and Sun “The impact of traditional and modern media on financial stability”"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/research/the-real-effects-of-bank-supervision-evidence-from-on-site-bank-inspections/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Real Effects of Bank Supervision - Evidence from On-Site Bank Inspections"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0d0b0060-4618-5d9b-97f3-f8a736095944","previousPostId":"8f7b128c-7f3f-54f8-90c1-ddeab8b3e845","nextPostId":"13ab825c-14d0-510e-8d0b-df9bfb2218db"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3343187749"],"slicesMap":{}}
